## Getting Started

* Java & Hadoop(MapReduce) are used in this application.
* Some real word problems, matrices are very large in size that is very time-consuming operation even though there are 
execution strategies on regular matrices and sparse matrices. Hence a MapReduce application is used to solve the problem 
of multiplying matrices of larger order in lesser time efficiently. 


Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
